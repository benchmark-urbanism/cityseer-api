`cityseer` is a collection of computational tools for fine-grained network and land-use analysis, useful for assessing the morphological precursors to vibrant neighbourhoods. It is underpinned by rigorous network-based methods that have been developed from the ground-up specifically for hyperlocal analysis at the pedestrian scale.

The use of `python` facilitates interaction with popular tools for network, geospatial, and scientific data analysis, i.e. [`networkX`](https://networkx.github.io/), [`shapely`](https://shapely.readthedocs.io), and the [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) stack. The underlying algorithms are designed for efficient large-scale urban analysis and have been implemented in [`numba`](https://numba.pydata.org/) JIT compiled code.
