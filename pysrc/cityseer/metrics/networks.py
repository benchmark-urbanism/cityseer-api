Compute network centralities.

There are three network centrality methods available depending on whether you're using a node-based or segment-based
approach, with the former available in both shortest and simplest (angular) variants.

- [`node_centrality_shortest`](#node-centrality-shortest)
- [`node_centrality_simplest`](#node-centrality-simplest)
- [`segment_centrality`](#segment-centrality)

These methods wrap the underlying `rust` optimised functions for computing centralities. Multiple classes of measures
and distances are computed simultaneously to reduce the amount of time required for multi-variable and multi-scalar
strategies.

See the accompanying paper on `arXiv` for additional information about methods for computing centrality measures.

:::note
The reasons for picking one approach over another are varied:

- Node based centralities compute the measures relative to each reachable node within the threshold distances. For
this reason, they can be susceptible to distortions caused by messy graph topologies such redundant and varied
concentrations of degree=2 nodes (e.g. to describe roadway geometry) or needlessly complex representations of
street intersections. In these cases, the network should first be cleaned using methods such as those available in
the [`graph`](/tools/graphs) module (see the [graph cleaning guide](/guide#graph-cleaning) for examples). If a
network topology has varied intensities of nodes but the street segments are less spurious, then segmentised methods
can be preferable because they are based on segment distances: segment aggregations remain the same regardless of
the number of intervening nodes, however, are not immune from situations such as needlessly complex representations
of roadway intersections or a proliferation of walking paths in greenspaces;
- Node-based `harmonic` centrality can be problematic on graphs where nodes are erroneously placed too close
together or where impedances otherwise approach zero, as may be the case for simplest-path measures or small
distance thesholds. This happens because the outcome of the division step can balloon towards $\infty$ once
impedances decrease below 1.
- Note that `cityseer`'s implementation of simplest (angular) measures work on both primal and dual graphs (node only).
- Measures should only be directly compared on the same topology because different topologies can otherwise affect
the expression of a measure. Accordingly, measures computed on dual graphs cannot be compared to measures computed
on primal graphs because this does not account for the impact of differing topologies. Dual graph representations
can have substantially greater numbers of nodes and edges for the same underlying street network; for example, a
four-way intersection consisting of one node with four edges translates to four nodes and six edges on the dual.
This effect is amplified for denser regions of the network.
- Segmentised versions of centrality measures should not be computed on dual graph topologies because street segment
lengths would be duplicated for each permutation of dual edge spanning street intersections. By way of example,
the contribution of a single edge segment at a four-way intersection would be duplicated three times.
- Global closeness is strongly discouraged because it does not behave suitably for localised graphs. Harmonic
closeness should be used instead.
- Network decomposition can be a useful strategy when working at small distance thresholds, and confers advantages
such as more regularly spaced snapshots and fewer artefacts at small distance thresholds where street edges
intersect distance thresholds. However, the regular spacing of the decomposed segments will introduce spikes in the
distributions of node-based centrality measures when working at very small distance thresholds. Segmentised versions
may therefore be preferable when working at small thresholds on decomposed networks.

    network representations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network_structure
        A [`rustalgos.NetworkStructure`](/rustalgos#networkstructure). Best generated with the
        [`io.network_structure_from_nx`](/tools/io#network-structure-from-nx) method.
    nodes_gdf
        A [`GeoDataFrame`](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/data_structures.html#geodataframe)
        representing nodes. Best generated with the
        [`io.network_structure_from_nx`](/tools/io#network-structure-from-nx) method. The outputs of
        calculations will be written to this `GeoDataFrame`, which is then returned from the method.
    distances: list[int]
        Distances corresponding to the local $d_{max}$ thresholds to be used for calculations. The $\beta$ parameters
        (for distance-weighted metrics) will be determined implicitly. If the `distances` parameter is not provided,
        then the `beta` parameter must be provided instead.
    betas: list[float]
        A $\beta$, or array of $\beta$ to be used for the exponential decay function for weighted metrics. The
        `distance` parameters for unweighted metrics will be determined implicitly. If the `betas` parameter is not
        provided, then the `distance` parameter must be provided instead.
    compute_closeness: bool
        Compute closeness centralities. True by default.
    compute_betweenness: bool
        Compute betweenness centralities. True by default.
    min_threshold_wt: float
        The default `min_threshold_wt` parameter can be overridden to generate custom mappings between the
        `distance` and `beta` parameters. See [`rustalgos.distances_from_beta`](/rustalgos#distances-from-betas) for
        more information.
    jitter_scale: float
        The scale of random jitter to add to shortest path calculations, useful for situations with highly
        rectilinear grids or for smoothing metrics on messy network representations. A random sample is drawn from a
        range of zero to one and is then multiplied by the specified `jitter_scale`. This random value is added to the
        shortest path calculations to provide random variation to the paths traced through the network. When working
        with shortest paths in metres, the random value represents distance in metres. When using a simplest path
        heuristic, the jitter will represent angular change in degrees.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes_gdf: GeoDataFrame
        The input `node_gdf` parameter is returned with additional columns populated with the calcualted metrics.

    Examples
    --------
    The following keys use the shortest-path heuristic:

    | node_cycles           | $$\sum_{j\neq{i}j=cycle}^{n}1$$ | A summation of network cycles. |
    | node_harmonic         | $$\sum_{j\neq{i}}^{n}\frac{1}{Z_{(i,j)}}$$ | Harmonic closeness is an appropriate form
    of closeness centrality for localised implementations constrained by the threshold $d_{max}$. |
    | node_beta             | $$\sum_{j\neq{i}}^{n}\exp(-\beta\cdot d[i,j])$$ | Also known as the gravity index.
    This is a spatial impedance metric differentiated from other closeness centralities by the use of an
    explicit $\beta$ parameter, which can be used to model the decay in walking tolerance as distances
    increase. |
    | node_betweenness      | $$\sum_{j\neq{i}}^{n}\sum_{k\neq{j}\neq{i}}^{n}1$$ | Betweenness centrality summing all
    shortest-paths traversing each node $i$. |
    | node_betweenness_beta | $$\sum_{j\neq{i}}^{n}\sum_{k\neq{j}\neq{i}}^{n}\exp(-\beta\cdot d[j,k])$$ | Applies a
    spatial impedance decay function to betweenness centrality. $d$ represents the full distance from
    any $j$ to $k$ node pair passing through node $i$. |
